*This branch only contains a settings.xml and a settings-security.xml file, so that we enable deployments for each successful build on master branch.*

## Implementing continuous delivery for htime
htime is a library for human readable datetime formatting for Java.
In this section we explain how we configures travis-ci to reach a continuous delivery pipeline.

### Procedure description
* Create a clean branch called travis, as specified in the first post.
* Add a settings.xml file referencing environment variables.
* Add a settings-security.xml file with a master password you generated. Instructions can be found [here](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html).
* Encrypt your repo password as specified at [this post](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html), and register it at Travis CI environment variables.
* Configure .travis.yml on all branches whitelisting just the branches to be built (master in our case).
* Add the following lines to your .travis.yml:

        before_install: "git clone -b travis `git config --get remote.origin.url` target/travis"
        script: "mvn deploy --settings target/travis/settings.xml -Dsettings.security=target/travis/settings-security.xml"

* Push changes and enjoy!
